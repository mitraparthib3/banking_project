  <h3>From a Bank to Financial Group</h3>
  <p>As   part of its mission to offer an ever-evolving array of services to the   entire region, AAIB developed new business arms to that effect. The   Bank?s growth was propelled in 2008 with the establishment of four   subsidiaries; Arab African Investment Holding (AAIH), Arab African   Investment Management (AAIM), Arab African International Securities   (AAIS) and Arab African International Mortgage Finance (AAIMF). The   establishment of which transformed AAIB from a Bank to a full-fledged   Financial Group.</p>
  <h3>Compliance</h3>
  <p>AAIBs Compliance department is responsible for ensuring that businesses operated by AAIB Group complies with current laws, regulations and professional best practices. The Compliance department also ensures the Group activities are carried out with the utmost professionalism. AAIB Group is committed to maintaining a high level of integrity and honesty in the running of its businesses, and requires its employees to follow both the text and the spirit of all applicable laws, regulations and professional practices.
As per the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) latest regulations and our Anti Money Laundering (AML) policy, we would like you to complete our AML Questionnaire and send it to us within 15 days to the following mailing address: </p>
  <h3>Corporate Social Responsibility</h3>
  <p>Whilst   undertaking a mission of achieving limitless growth, AAIB?s foresight   in terms of social consciousness became reality as early as 2003, with a   belief that brands must be inspirational in socially responsible   manner.</p>
<p>
AAIB   embraced a transformative idea of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)   being an engrained component of AAIB?s Core Values System. Applying   this with a distinctively unique approach, AAIB set the trend for   Sustainable Finance with Value Creation.</p>
<p>Aside from being a recipient of world renowned Banking and Finance Awards throughout the past decade, AAIB?s CSR and Sustainability practices were recognized in 2012 by Arabia CSR Network, who presented AAIB with a special award for being the first bank in Egypt and the region to establish its own Foundation for Social Development in Health and Education: We Owe It to Egypt.</p>
